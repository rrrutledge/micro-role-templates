The _Scribe_ ensures that meeting notes are taken and sends them out.

## Day Before Meeting

* Reserve time on tomorrow's calendar to clean up the notes and send them out.
This time should be scheduled as close as possible after the end of the meeting.

## During Meeting

* At the beginning, encourage everyone present to open up the agenda/notes document and type directly into it.
* Watch closely what is being typed to ensure that all sections of the agenda document are filled out completely.
Anything that is missed type in yourself.

## Within 24 Hours of Meeting

* Clean up everyone's notes plus your own into a cohesive record of the meeting.
* Announce in [chat] that the notes are in the agenda document.
In your announcement include a sharing link to the document itself.
* Reply-all to the meeting invite with the notes from the meeting.
This email should include (in order):

  * Generic thank-you to meeting participants.
  * Link to the agenda document where the notes are located.
  * Copy/pasted notes from the agenda document.

### Tips

* Ensure that a regular attendee who is not at the meeting could understand what happened by the notes only.
* Make sure the notes are clear and to the point.
Part of your service as _Scribe_ is to summarize the key points of what was said
so that recipients don't need to wade through all of the conversation in order to understand its essentials.
